# Frisbee Trajectory Simulation

A simulation program that generates a visualization of the flight trajectory of a frisbee flying through air.

## Usage
The C++ program is used to generate the 3-dimensional coordinates of the frisbee's flight trajectory and involves a lot of vector math. The initial conditions at which the frisbee is thrown can be manually modified in the code. The generated file containing the coordinates is in a .csv format and is stored in the /simulation_data folder. To visualize the data into a 3D plot, simply run the Python script. A screenshot of the 3D plot is saved automatically in the /trajectories folder.
